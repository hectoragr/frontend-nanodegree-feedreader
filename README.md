# RSS Feed


## Overview

Given a web-based app that reads RSS feeds using Google JSAPI, we make sure the reader works as expected using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

## Usage

When you first load the page you will see the feed from Udacity's blog, and the navitagion menu is hidden.

You can then navigate to the next sections

###Â Udacity blog
Returns the last 10 entries in the main blog for [Udacity](https://blog.udacity.com)

### CSS Tricks
Content from [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/)

### HTML5 Rocks
Content from both [Google Developer](https://developers.google.com) and [html5rocks.com](https://www.html5rocks.com/)

### Linear Digressions
Links to multiple episodes in [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) by [Linear Digressions](http://lineardigressions.com/)


## Testing

To verify the Feed Reader is working just load the homepage of the Feed Reader and at the very bottom everything should be green.
